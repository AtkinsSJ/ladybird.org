### Expanding our Board of Directors

We've added two new board members:

- [Tim Flynn](https://ladybird.org/posts/tim-flynn-joins-board/): one of our long-term independent contributors. Ladybird leans on the OSS community, and we want to ensure our project remains open and pleasant for independent contributors!

- [Mike Shaver](https://ladybird.org/posts/mike-shaver-joins-board/): a browser industry veteran, former VP of Engineering at Mozilla, Director of Engineering at Facebook, and many other things. Mike is a hardcore engineering leader and will help us raise the bar for Ladybird and ourselves.
